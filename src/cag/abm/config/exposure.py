"""Political-exposure vocabularies: target marginals + affinity weights.

Relocated from :mod:`cag.abm.environment` (v0.8) so the exposure
vocabularies live in one discoverable place alongside the other
subsystem configs (see :mod:`cag.abm.config`). The affinity *scoring* and
*assignment* logic (``_green_affinity_score`` / ``_reform_affinity_score``
/ ``assign_political_exposure``) remains in ``environment.py`` and imports
the data from here. ``environment.py`` also re-exports every public name
below for backward compatibility, so existing
``from cag.abm.environment import TARGET_PRESETS`` imports keep working.

This block supports three selection modes consumed by
``SurveyedNation.assign_political_exposure()``:
  - "rule_priority_chain"   : legacy v0.5 rule (kept for reproducibility)
  - "rule_signal_count"     : reserved (alias of priority_chain for now)
  - "rule_affinity_rank"    : NEW default; deterministic top-K on affinity

Design notes (see documentation/research/Model_Design.md §18 and
docs/Literature_Political_Exposure.md §6-§7 for full reasoning):

WHY target marginals are not inherited from the YouGov sample. The
YouGov panel is recruited politically-engaged; left to its own devices
the four-cell split is ~A 27 / B 19 / both 49 / neither 5, which inverts
the UK media-reality asymmetry (B > A) and under-counts the disengaged
tier by an order of magnitude. We therefore calibrate the targets to
UK population-level evidence and re-sample the YouGov pool to hit them.

WHY a committed-minority symmetric default (45 % "neither"). Reuters
DNR 2024 selective news avoidance is 46 %; Hansard Audit of Political
Engagement 16 (2019) reports ~40 % "not much / not at all" interested in
politics; Britain Talks Climate disengaged segments together ~25-30 %.
The lit-supported band for "no party-attributed broadcast receipt" is
35-60 %. We adopt 45 % as a compromise between the lit (50-60 %) and
the user's earlier 30-40 % intuition; this is documented in
Literature_Political_Exposure.md §6.2.

WHY symmetric default with the April-2024 asymmetric preset as a named
override. Symmetric reach is the cleanest counter-factual for studying
committed-minority dynamics in isolation; asymmetry is then an
*experimental control*, not an embedded assumption. The April-2024
anchor uses JL Partners' GB News viewer panel (15-22 Apr 2024, n=518:
Con 39 % / Reform 20 % / Lab 8 %) for Reform reach, and the comparable
absence of any Green broadcast vehicle for the A side.

# Affinity-score weight presets. Each preset is a dict {"A": {...}, "B": {...}}
# of weights applied to the per-signal contributions in
# ``_green_affinity_score`` / ``_reform_affinity_score``.
#
# WHY hand-picked weights, not fitted. No UK individual-level ground
# truth exists for who is in which echo chamber, so any fitted
# coefficients would be circular. Hand-picked priors anchored to
# published correlations are honest about the uncertainty and remain
# overridable via ``SIM_CONFIG["affinity_weights"]``.
#
# WHY a three-tier, factor-2 scheme (political 2.0 / values 1.0 /
# demographics 0.5). Only the *relative ordering* of the weights matters
# for the rank-based assignment (absolute magnitude is a nuisance
# parameter), so the default uses a clean, easily-defended tier ladder
# rather than a table of finely-tuned decimals:
#
#   Tier 1 — political self-report (brexit, politics, vote_bonus) = 2.0
#     Vote choice and left-right / Leave-Remain self-placement are the
#     strongest empirical proxies for partisan media diet
#     (Fletcher & Nielsen 2017), so they carry the heaviest tier. The
#     tier is still bounded, so values + demographics together can
#     out-vote a single political signal — satisfying the "more than
#     just voting history" requirement.
#
#   Tier 2 — psychological values (openness, selftransc, conformtrad,
#     sdo, rwa) = 1.0. Schwartz-values and authoritarianism scales are
#     robust attitudinal predictors of pro-/anti-environmental stance
#     (Steg & de Groot 2010 line of work) but are one step removed from
#     the media-consumption behaviour we are ranking on.
#
#   Tier 3 — demographics (age, education, region) = 0.5. Proxies rather
#     than direct attitudinal indicators, so weighted at half the values
#     tier.
#
# The "vote_dominant" / "values_dominant" presets below deliberately
# break this ladder to probe robustness (NB 27); the factor-2 spacing
# here keeps the default's narrative simple.
