## Overview
**Climate-Action-GABM** is a generative-AI agent-based model (GABM) of UK climate-policy opinion dynamics, built on the [GABM](https://github.com/compolis/GABM/) framework. It is designed to study a question that classical opinion-dynamics models handle only crudely: how do two **competing committed minorities** — small, organised groups that press opposing messages — move the opinion of a larger majority, and under what conditions does one side gain ground?

In a GABM, agents are driven by Large Language Models (LLMs): each is given a human-like persona and generates natural-language messages, private reflections, and survey answers. Storing those prompts and responses and feeding them back as context lets the model represent how repeated exposure to persuasion — and to the reflections of network neighbours — reshapes an agent's stated position over time, and how those individual shifts cascade through a social network into collective change. Classical committed-minority models collapse a group's influence into a single abstract weight; because a GABM's agents process natural-language arguments against their own personas, it can pull those levers apart.

### The model
This first model simulates opinion on **six UK climate policies** — renewable energy, banning fossil-fuel extraction, banning petrol cars, green housing, a carbon tax, and climate compensation. It has three kinds of agent:

- **Citizen agents.** Each is anchored to a *real respondent* in a representative **YouGov survey** (UK, late April 2024), so the simulation **starts from observed opinions** rather than from a language model's typically over-optimistic prior. A model-ready subset of `N=1,483` respondents (from ~1,967 raw) is the sampling pool; reported runs draw a cohort of `N=100`. Each agent's persona — demographics, voting history, and a psychological value profile (Schwartz values, RWA/SDO) — is assembled into a prompt the LLM adopts for the whole run.
- **Two committed-minority agents.** Loosely modelled on **Reform UK** (climate-sceptic) and the **Green Party** (pro-climate), they broadcast persuasive messages drawn from a fixed, curated pool for each side. The messages are synthetic but each is grounded in the parties' real online climate communications (manifestos, parliamentary speeches, press statements).

A simulated **day** runs as: one or both minority agents broadcast to citizens over a configurable social network (default: a weak-homophily stochastic block model) → citizens reflect privately → citizens exchange peer messages with network neighbours and reflect again → every citizen is re-administered the original survey instrument, recording opinion on a 7-point scale (*Strongly oppose → Strongly support*). Who hears each broadcast is set by an **affinity-ranked exposure** rule that weights political signals above values above demographics.

### Memory and bias control
Each citizen carries a **six-section tiered memory** ([docs/Model_Design.md](documentation/research/Model_Design.md) §28) that ranks context as persona + values → Day-0 anchor (verbatim from the agent's own Day-0 rationale) → daily summaries (older days) → recent reflections → own reasoning → today-so-far. A split between **context scope** (`policy_id`) and **question scope** (`target_policy_id`) lets package-mode end-of-day surveys see cross-policy reflections while staying anchored to the specific policy being asked. Two mechanisms hold known LLM survey bias in check: a **Day-0 ground-truth anchor** that ties each agent to its real starting opinion, and a **two-step debiased survey** prompt (reason first, then answer).

### What the experiments test
A resource advantage can take **different forms**, and the framework holds them apart so their effects can be estimated separately:

- **Reach** — how large a share of citizens a side can broadcast to (`reach_a` / `reach_b`);
- **Frequency** — how often a side broadcasts across a run (`--broadcasts-a/-b`);
- **Targeting** — how selectively a limited broadcast is aimed (`random` / `persuadable` / `degree` / `betweenness`).

The central finding of the accompanying paper is that the **form** of a resource asymmetry, not merely its magnitude, shapes which side moves the majority. Alongside the simulation, the repo ships a **fit-for-purpose evaluation protocol** — including a persona-null ablation that checks whether the model actually conditions on each agent's assigned persona. We are careful about epistemic status: the evidence targets **internal validity and algorithmic fidelity**, not a claim that the model reproduces real-world opinion change.

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Clone
git clone https://github.com/compolis/Climate-Action-GABM.git
cd Climate-Action-GABM

# 2. Install the runtime dependencies (Python 3.12+)
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 3. Choose an LLM backend:
#    3a. Cloud (OpenAI / Anthropic / Google) — add your API keys, see API_KEYS.md
#    3b. Fully offline on a local LLM — install a local runtime and serve a
#        model, see docs/Local_LLM_Setup_Guide.md (pip install -r requirements-local.txt)

# 4. Preview the canonical smoke run (validates config, makes no LLM calls)
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m cag --preset smoke --dry-run

# 5. See the available run presets and every configurable knob
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m cag --list-presets

## Current Status

**v0.9 — first behaviour-bearing release after the v0.8 refactor track.** Adds a persona-null ablation (a manipulation check on whether the model conditions on each agent's persona), a broadcast-frequency-asymmetry CLI (one side can out-broadcast the other across a whole run), per-side reach targeting (`persuadable` / `degree` / `betweenness`), a degree-proportional peer-relay option (well-connected citizens can relay their reflection to more neighbours), a simplified three-tier affinity-weight ladder, and a full observability layer (per-agent prompt capture, reached-flags, bucket-summary + targeting-diagnostics tables, and eight new diagnostic figures). Default behaviour is unchanged — `persona_mode="real"`, 1-vs-1 broadcasting, `reach_targeting="random"`, and `peer_fanout_mode="constant"` reproduce prior canon bit-for-bit. All `src/cag/` modules now declare `__version__ = "0.9.0"`.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Tests | **680 passing, 1 skipped** |
| Behaviour additions (v0.9) | persona-null ablation (`apply_persona_mode`: real / shuffled / neutral); broadcast-frequency CLI (`--broadcasts-a/-b`, `--interleave`); per-side reach targeting (`--reach-targeting-a/-b`: random / persuadable / degree / betweenness); degree-proportional peer relay (`--peer-fanout-mode` degree / betweenness, `additive` / `preserve` budget, off by default); three-tier affinity-weight ladder (political 2.0 / values 1.0 / demographics 0.5) |
| Observability (v0.9) | `agent_prompts.csv` (stratified full prompt/response capture); `reached_by_a/_b` flags; `bucket_summary.csv` + `targeting_diagnostics.csv`; eight new diagnostic figures (trajectories-by-bucket, polarization, drift-from-GT, ridgeline, network before/after, targeting mechanism, reach QC, calibration) |
| Refactor track (v0.8) | [src/cag/abm/sim.py](src/cag/abm/sim.py) split 2755 → 838 lines; focused modules under [src/cag/io/](src/cag/io/) and [network_repair.py](src/cag/abm/network_repair.py); v2 six-section tiered-memory architecture (`policy_id` vs `target_policy_id` scope split) |
| Notebooks | 46 (01–46) |
| Source files | 32 under `src/cag/` |
