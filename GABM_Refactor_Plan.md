# CAG to GABM Refactor Plan

**Status:** agreed direction; implementation not started.
**Audit date:** 2026-11-08.

## Purpose

Move reusable capabilities from Climate-Action-GABM (CAG) into the GABM
framework, then make CAG a thinner consumer of those capabilities. This is a
two-repository refactor, not just a dependency upgrade or a replacement of CAG
with GABM's chat examples.

Preserve CAG's research behaviour while improving framework reuse. Intentional
behaviour changes require a separate decision, explicit documentation, and
appropriate tests; they must not be hidden inside an extraction.

This document is the maintained implementation reference. The
[roadmap](ROADMAP.md) records the strategic goal, and the
[developer guide](DEV_GUIDE.md) links contributors here. For current model
behaviour, consult the [configuration guide](docs/Simulation_Configuration_Guide.md),
[code tour](docs/Code_Tour.md), and source code. The
[model design log](docs/Model_Design.md) contains historical decisions and is not an
authoritative current specification.

## Verified starting point

The audit used published PyPI packages in an isolated Python 3.12 environment,
not the adjacent GABM source checkout.

| Check | Published GABM 0.2.18 | Published GABM 0.3.0 |
|---|---|---|
| Unchanged CAG full test suite | 680 passed, 1 skipped; 23 subtests passed; 6 warnings | Blocked by 9 collection errors |
| `python -m cag --preset smoke --dry-run` | Passed | Failed on the missing `politics` import |

Commands, with the isolated environment activated:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src:scripts MPLBACKEND=Agg python -m pytest -q
PYTHONPATH=src python -m cag --preset smoke --dry-run
```

These are dated audit results, not a permanently current test count. A dry-run
only previews configuration: it is not an executed simulation or evidence of
pre/post output equivalence. The existing suite is valuable, but several
simulation and checkpoint tests mock the nation and agent internals.

Known compatibility breaks:

- GABM 0.3.0 has no `gabm.abm.attributes.politics`, `ethnicity`, or `family`
  modules. CAG source, tests, and 27 notebooks contain affected imports.
- The published `Nation` constructor accepts `name` rather than `place`, and
  no longer accepts `ethnicity_map`.
- CAG's runtime, development, and Conda manifests still pin `gabm==0.2.18`.

No CAG runtime code or dependency pins were changed during the audit.

## Ownership boundaries

Extract mechanisms, not entire domain-bearing modules. Reuse existing GABM
APIs before adding new ones; keep a new API small and supported by a concrete
CAG use case.

| Capability | Generic responsibility in GABM | Responsibility retained in CAG |
|---|---|---|
| Attributes | Identifiers, attribute objects, and maps | YouGov categories, coding, and descriptions |
| Networks | Seeded graph builders and structural diagnostics | Political-exposure grouping, affinity rules, and research defaults |
| LLM access | Transport, request options, retries, response metadata, and explicit cache controls | Climate prompts, debiasing, and survey-answer interpretation |
| Memory | Reusable event storage, retention, and summarisation mechanisms | Context wording, policy scopes, anchors, and research presets |
| Checkpoints | Reusable persistence and compatibility mechanisms | CAG state schema, state hydration, and resume rules |
| Experiments | Seed sweeps, provenance, and comparison utilities | Climate outcomes, calibration, and scientific analyses |

Networks, LLM access, memory, checkpoints, and experiments are extraction
candidates, not commitments to build a general abstraction for every row.
In particular:

- [Network code](src/cag/abm/networks.py) mixes generic graph algorithms
  with political-exposure grouping.
- [Memory configuration](src/cag/abm/config/memory.py) mixes retention
  mechanics with the survey design.
- [LLM access](src/cag/io/llm.py) returns text from system/user prompts.
  GABM's existing LLM service contract returns response objects and enables
  caching by default. Direct substitution could change prompts, calls, or
  failures and needs a deliberate adapter.

Do not introduce GABM-generated traits, names, values, or age sampling into
survey-grounded CAG citizens as an incidental consequence of inheritance.
Do not replace the CAG daily phase loop with a generic chat example.

## Sequence and acceptance gates

### 1. Establish a golden integration fixture

Before runtime edits, execute a small seeded scenario with real CAG citizens
and a real `SurveyedNation`, mocking only LLM transport and external services
as needed. Record the input data, complete configuration, dependency versions,
and deterministic response strategy.

Capture personas and exact prompts, agent IDs, graph nodes and edges, exposure
and reach assignments, ordered messages and reflections, surveys, memory, and
saved outputs. Include package-mode communication and peer exchange; cover
single-policy behaviour and checkpoint/resume in companion checks.

**Gate:** the fixture repeats exactly against 0.2.18 and provides reusable
pre/post comparison evidence. Keep synthetic fixtures in tests; do not commit
credentials, private survey records, or large generated run directories.

### 2. Resolve published 0.3.0 compatibility

- Define CAG survey attribute types using GABM's generic attribute primitives,
  preserving existing ID ordinals, labels, lookups, and serialization.
- Update imports across source, tests, and affected notebook code cells.
- Adapt the `SurveyedNation` constructor, retaining its public CAG arguments
  and explicitly storing the CAG ethnicity map.
- Update [runtime requirements](requirements.txt),
  [development requirements](requirements-dev.txt),
  [Conda environment](environment.yaml), and directly related docs together.

**Gate:** the existing suite, CLI smoke dry-run, and golden comparisons pass
against the published 0.3.0 wheel. Do not leave a version-only upgrade that
cannot import or run.

### 3. Extract seeded networks and diagnostics first

Move a bounded set of generic graph builders and diagnostics into GABM.
CAG supplies agent IDs, its block membership or similarity inputs, and its
research defaults. Preserve node ordering, random-number usage, edge results,
diagnostic output, and existing connectivity-repair behaviour.

**Gate:** GABM tests exercise the generic API independently of CAG, while CAG
tests and golden comparisons demonstrate unchanged graphs and downstream
behaviour through the new API.

### 4. Adapt LLM transport, then evaluate memory extraction

Inventory and reuse GABM's existing services before moving CAG transport code
upstream. Explicitly preserve system/user message roles, generation options,
local endpoint support, model-specific options, timeout and retry behaviour,
error propagation, and cache policy. Keep survey parsing in CAG.

Only then identify the smallest reusable memory boundary. Preserve context
section order and exact text, retention/compression timing, policy-versus-
question scope, and checkpoint state.

**Gate:** transport tests verify request shapes and failure paths; integration
comparisons verify prompts, call order, memory, and outputs. Any intentional
difference is separately approved and tested.

### 5. Evaluate further extractions

Consider checkpoint infrastructure and experiment provenance/comparison helpers
after the earlier slices demonstrate a useful pattern. Retain CAG-specific
schemas and analysis. Do not generalise speculatively or relocate HPC scripts
merely to match a framework example.

## Two-repository development and release workflow

1. Keep CAG as the active application workspace and GABM as the framework
   development/reference checkout. Use separate, focused changes in each.
2. For each extraction, document the API boundary and acceptance evidence.
   Add generic tests in GABM and keep domain/integration tests in CAG.
3. Test CAG against an isolated editable GABM checkout while developing new
   APIs. Record the GABM commit; an editable checkout is not release evidence.
4. Validate the built GABM wheel with CAG before publishing a new release.
5. Release GABM, then pin CAG to that published version and rerun the gates
   without source-path overrides. GABM 0.3.0 cannot supply APIs added later.
6. Update this plan's progress, the change log, and affected usage/API docs.
   Follow each repository's contribution and release process.

Exact comparisons apply to deterministic fixture data and mocked transport.
Exclude only declared volatile fields such as wall-clock timestamps, not
scientifically meaningful differences. Live hosted/HPC runs are a separate
validation layer: a fixed application seed does not guarantee identical LLM
responses. Record model/server settings, request seeds where supported, cache
policy, and backend fingerprints where available; assess live variation
separately from structural refactor regressions.
